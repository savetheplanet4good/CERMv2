"""Final losses can be greater than the principal of the portfolio considering that all loans are amortized.
Indeed, amortization makes default a non-absorbing state: when a loan defaults ang goes back to rating i<K, 
we consider that the bank has taken out a loan with same EAD after the former loan had been defaulted on.
This is why the bank can eventually lose more than its portfolio principal. 
Amortization coefficient should be negligible in that regard."""
